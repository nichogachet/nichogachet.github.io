**The empirics of populism and distributive politics: The case of Ecuador** <span style="color:blue">[New version coming soon !!)]</span>.

: **Abstract:**  What electoral strategies do populist regimes employ to implement institutional reforms? I use as a setting the case of Ecuador in the initial phase of the Correa regime. Correa emerged as an unknown figure in politics and achieved victory with a new political party, no congressmenn and no local candidates. Consequently, the vote share of this election provides a reasonably good proxy for initial affinity towards a populist politician. During its peak, from 2006 to 2010, the regime implemented several institutional reforms, including a new Constitution, which were approved via direct referendums. By employing transcripts from Correa's weekly speeches delivered in-person across the country, I show that institutional changes and populist-type discourse are strategically allocated in areas where a populist has its initial core supporters. This result is relevant since it shows that populists are not necessarily overconfident due to their public appeal; instead, they may prefer to be conservative and avoid taking electorally risky strategies.
